                      Soup Kitchens in the America are run by experts in the field – and they’re ready to bring you into the fold. The best part: Spending a few hours sorting, packing or stacking food can make an enormous difference for the food banks and the families they serve.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      Soup kitchen volunteers share their skills and make a huge impact. Every volunteer experience is a little different, for example, food banks could need your help sorting and packing food, gardening, or educating the community. Each experience is critical in helping get healthy meals to families facing hunger.

                      Soup Kitchen partners with local leaders to launch food banking operations in communities where they had not previously existed. Since 2006, Soup Kitchens has supported the launch of food banking organizations in 15 countries, making it possible for people in need to have access to food, and empowering those communities to support those who suffer from hunger and lack of nutrition.
                  </p>
  
                  <p>
                      Food banks change lives and help uplift communities by reducing hunger and malnutrition. We encourage communities to enact a food banking system that benefits members of their community. 
                      If you’re interested in starting a food bank, download GFN’s ToolKit – Feasibility Analysis: Starting a Food Bank System.
